I'll be soon working on a school project, which led me to look for a place where to version my code.

Since I use GitHub daily, I first checked its plans. The cheapest one, called micro, gives 5 private repos for $7/month. I unfortunately need only a single private repo, and I don't want to pay for 4 ones that I probably won't be using.

Although I knew about Bitbucket's free private repos, the ideas of leaving GitHub and having my repos here and there didn't please me that much.

Luckily, I stumbled upon GitHub's Educational offers, that are available to both teachers and students.  
The teachers' offer concerns an organization account, and since I'm no teacher and I don't know much about it and it doesn't concern me, I won't talk it over.  
The students' offer on the other hand is simply a micro plan. It lasts 2 years, enough to get you ass a job and pay your subscription.

To benefit from this offer, just contact GitHub from this page Request an educational account.
Make sure you are logged in with the account you want the plan for, and tell them why you need that free plan for.

Code well, and thanks GitHub! :)
