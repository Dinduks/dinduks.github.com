I'll be soon working on a school project, which led me to look for a place where to version my code.

Since I use GitHub daily, I checked its plans first. The cheapest one, called *micro*, gives 5 private repos for $7/month. I unfortunately only need a single private repo, and I don't want to pay for 4 ones that I probably won't be using.

Although I knew about Bitbucket's free private repos, the ideas of leaving GitHub and having my repos here and there didn't please me that much.

Luckily, I stumbled upon [GitHub's Educational offers](https://github.com/edu), that are available to both teachers and students.  
The teachers' offer concerns organization accounts. And the students' one on the other hand is simply a micro plan, and lasts 2 years, enough to get your ass a job and pay a subscription.

To benefit from this offer, just contact GitHub from the [Request an educational account](https://github.com/edu) page.  
Make sure you are logged in with the account you want the plan for, and tell them why you need it.

Thank you GitHub!
