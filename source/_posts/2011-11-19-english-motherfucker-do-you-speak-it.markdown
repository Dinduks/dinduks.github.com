Hi there!

It has been a while since I started thinking about writing in English, but I neither had the time nor had I the strength to do it, especially that I wanted to write not only in English but also in French. 
Now I realized that writing in both languages isn't worth it since developers understand English. Besides it will take me less time to write in one language rather than two. 

I made this decision mainly to reach more people: more people -> more interaction/feedback -> more knowledge. 

So from now on, all my technical posts will be written in English.

Happy reading. :)
